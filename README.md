# Hi thereðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘‹

my name is Jochen Rui. I'm a Software Engineer from the south of Germany.
My defining qualities as a Software Engineer are that I'm always eager to improve and learn new technologies.
As a person I just like to try and learn new things. DIY is a ton of fun I think.

At the moment I'm actively looking for a full time position where I can learn and improve while working on a product that interests me

## Here's a little information about my current situation

### Learning 
* currently I'm spending most of my time improving on my knowledge in Design Pattern, Backend technologies & Testing
* lately I've been working a lot if IaaC as well and I'm steadily improving there

### Reading
* as of now I'm reading Head First Design Patterns by Freeman et. al 2004. It's fun to read and the Design Patterns are explained in a way that helps to memorize them. I love that.
* next on the list would be Clean Code by Robert C. Martin 2009

### Interests
* in my free time I like to leetcode, play video games, work on my car, play the guitar or try to fix stuff at home, although I barely have time at the moment
